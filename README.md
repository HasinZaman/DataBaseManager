## Manual

### general
 
The application can only be navigated through the commands inputted to the console.

 - All `letter`, `number` and `symbol` keys input characters into the console
 - `Enter` key is used to execute commands
 - `Down Arrow` key retrieves the previously executed command
 - `Up Arrow` key retrieves the next most recently executed command or draft command

### Schema Tab

The schema tab is used to see the architecture of the database

Any of the following commands open's the Schema Tab

 - `show *` command is used to show the definition of every table and view the database
 - `show views` command is used to show the definition of every view on the database
 - `show tables` command is used to show the definition of every table on the database
 - `show [table or view name]` command is used to show all the details relating to the definition of a specific table or view

Note: Font colour is used to refer primary key constraint, while highlighter colour is used to refer to foreign key constraint. The same font and highlight colour refer to a primary-foreign key relation.

### Query Tab

The query tab is used to see the state of tuples in views and tables in the database

Only valid `SELECT` SQL commands be used to open the Query Tab

- `SELECT ...` commands define which tuples are viewed
- `next` command is used to get the next page of tuples
- `prev` command is used to get the previous page of tuples

ex. Show all the tuples that exist in the natural join of two tables

```SQL
SELECT * FROM table_1, table_2 WHERE table_1.id = table_2.id
```

ex. Show all tuples greater than 30

```SQL
SELECT * FROM table_1 WHERE table_1.n > 30
```

### Snapshot Tab

The snapshot tab is used to add, remove or rollback the database to a given point in the database's history

Only a `snapshot` command can open the Snapshot page

 - `snapshot` command opens the snapshot page
 - `add` command adds a new snapshot from the current database
 - `remove [row or name]` command removes the snapshot
 - `rollback [row or name]` command is used to rollback the database to the specified snapshot
